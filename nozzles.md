# Nozzles

In nozzle is any tube-like thing that a fluid flows out of. There's probably a more technical definition, but I don't know it.

 When things flow *out of* something, they are flowing *into* something else (open air, a vacuum, a tank, etc..)

Nozzles have a lot of important applications and when you learn about fluids, you learn a lot about flow through a nozzle.

When you learn how to analyize nozzle flow you learn one important thing:

When fluid exits a nozzle, it will be at the ambient pressure outside of the nozzle.

Therefore, if a nozzle sprays into the open air, then the fluid exiting the nozzle will be at ambient pressure (zero pressure relative to the air around it).

The spray *will have velocity* but velocity is a separate property from pressure.

That means while exiting the nozzle, the fluid flow will have accelerated, turning all of it's pressure into velocity.
